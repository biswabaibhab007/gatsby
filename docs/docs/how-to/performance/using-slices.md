title: Using Slices
---

> Support for the Gatsby Slice API was added in `gatsby@5.0.0`.

To further the improvements seen by [Incremental Builds](/blog/2020-04-22-announcing-incremental-builds/), Gatsby includes the [Slice API](/docs/reference/built-in-components/gatsby-slice) that allows you to split pages into individual parts.

By using the `<Slice>` React component in combination with the [`createSlice`](/docs/reference/config-files/actions/#createSlice) API for common UI features, Gatsby will be able to build and deploy individual pieces of your site that had content changes, not just entire pages.

The `<Slice>` React component is also referred to as "Slice placeholder". The React component you pass to `createSlice` via its `component` key is also referred to as "Slice template".

## Faster builds in Gatsby Cloud

With the introduction of Incremental Builds, Gatsby Cloud has been able to reduce build times signficantly by only building the pages that changed. The Gatsby Slice API helps reduce those builds times further.

Common components that are shared across the majority of pages on your site might include a navigation bar, footer, or contact form. In today's frameworks, when you re-order the navigation bar items, the entire site needs to be rebuilt. However, if the navigation bar was created as a Slice template, the new navigation items only need to be built once and all pages will pull the new navigation bar when it's needed.

## Using Slices in your site

For this example, let's use the same scenario as described above - a large site that has a shared navigation bar. You'll use this component as your Slice template.

```javascript:title=src/layouts/default-layout.jsx
import { NavigationBar, Footer } from "../components"

export const DefaultLayout = ({ children, navigationBarClassName }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <NavigationBar className={navigationBarClassName} />
      {content}
      <Footer />
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Creating the Slice template in `gatsby-node`

Creating a Slice template is done by using the [`createSlice`](/docs/reference/config-files/actions/#createSlice) action from the [`createPages`](/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-node/#createPages) API in your `gatsby-node`.

```javascript:title=gatsby-node.js
exports.createPages = async ({ actions }) => {
  actions.createSlice({
    id: `navigation-bar`,
    component: require.resolve(`./src/components/navigation-bar.js`),
  })
}
```

Now that you have a `navigation-bar` Slice template created, let's go use it!

### Using the Slice placeholder

Now you need to convert the `DefaultLayout` component to actually use the new Slice template you created. By importing the `<Slice />` component from `gatsby` and placing the Slice placeholder inside your component you can use the previously created `navigation-bar` template.

```diff
+import { Slice } from "gatsby"
-import { NavigationBar, Footer } from "../components"
+import { Footer } from "../components"

export const DefaultLayout = ({ children, navigationBarClassName }) => {
  return (
    <div className={styles.defaultLayout} />
-     <NavigationBar className={navigationBarClassName} />
+     <Slice alias="navigation-bar" className={navigationBarClassName} />
      {content}
      <Footer />
    </div>
  )
}
```

After a successful `gatsby build`, you should see a list of `Slices` that were built for your site. We've created a Slice!

### Using `sliceContext`

Similar to the context that can be passed to pages in [`createPages`](/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-node/#createPages), [`createSlice`](/docs/reference/config-files/actions/#createSlice) can also pass context to individual slice templates.

```javascript:title=gatsby-node.js
exports.createPages = async ({ actions }) => {
  actions.createSlice({
    id: `navigation-bar`,
    context: {
      jokeOfTheDay: `What's blue and not heavy? Light blue.`,
    },
    component: require.resolve(`./src/components/navigation-bar.js`),
  })
}
```

The data passed to `context` here will be handed down to the `NavigationBar` Slice template with the key `sliceContext`.

```javascript:title=src/components/navigation-bar.jsx
// highlight-next-line
const NavigationBar = ({ className, sliceContext }) => {
  return (
    <div className={className}>
      <Link to="/">Home</Link>
      // highlight-next-line
      <Link to="/jokes">{sliceContext.jokeOfTheDay}</Link>
    </div>
  )
}

export default NavigationBar
```

### Querying Data

Data can be queried the same way you can run queries within pages. These are called "slice queries" (as opposed to [page queries](/docs/how-to/querying-data/page-query)).

In this example, let's say you want to pull all navigation items from your CMS.

```js:title=src/components/my-slice.js
const NavigationBar = ({ data }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      {data.allNavigationItems.nodes.forEach(navigationItem = (
        // highlight-next-line
        <Link to={navigationItem.path}>{navigationItem.text}</Link>
      ))}
    </div>
  )
}

export default NavigationBar

export const query = graphql`
  query {
    allNavigationItems {
      nodes {
        path
        text
      }
    }
  }
`
```

When Gatsby builds, this query will be ran and passed to `NavigationBar` within the `data` prop, just like [page queries](/docs/how-to/querying-data/page-query).

Slice queries can also accept parameters from the `context` passed to `createSlice`.

```js:title=src/components/my-slice.js
export const query = graphql`
  // highlight-next-line
  query ($title: String) {
    // highlight-next-line
    myField(title: {eq: $title}) {
      id
      title
    }
  }
`
```

### Using Aliases

There will be times where a single Slice will either need to be handed different context or swapped entirely depending on which page it's being rendered on.

This is where you can utilize the `alias` prop that is given to the `<Slice>` placeholder. When you converted the `<NavigationBar>` component to a Slice template, you created the Slice template with an `id` of `navigation-bar`, but passed that value to the `alias` prop of the `<Slice>` placeholder. Why is there a difference in key names?

An `alias` is not a 1-to-1 mapping of string-to-slice. When you create a page using [`createPages`](/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-node/#createPages), you can pass a key-value map of alias-to-id to tell Gatsby which Slice template to use throughout the page.

One common use case for this is localization. It's common to iterate over languages to create a page for each one. You can create a Slice for each language by passing `context`. The `id` that a Slice template is created with will be passed to [`createPage`](/docs/reference/config-files/actions/#createPage) to tell each page which Slice template to use.

In this example, you create a Slice template of `<NavigationBar>` for each supported language. When you create each page, Gatsby will tell the page which `navigation-bar` to use based on the language of the page Gatsby is creating.

```javascript:title=gatsby-node.js
const SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES = ['en', 'de', 'es']

exports.createPages = async ({ actions }) => {
  // create a slice with a unique ID for each language
  SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES.forEach(language => {
    actions.createSlice({
      // highlight-next-line
      id: `navigation-bar-${language}`,
      context: { language },
      component: require.resolve(`./src/components/navigation-bar.js`),
    })
  })

  // Query for all pages
  const pagesResult = await graphql('...')

  // Create a page for each page node + language
  pagesResult.data.edges.forEach(({ node }) => {
    SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES.forEach(language => {
      createPage({
        path: node.path,
        // a page component that utilizes DefaultLayout
        component: require.resolve(`./src/templates/page.js`),
        context: {
          pagePath: node.path,
          language,
        },
        slices: {
          // Any time `<Slice alias="navigation-bar">` is seen on this page,
          // use the `navigation-bar-${language}` id
          // highlight-next-line
          'navigation-bar': `navigation-bar-${language}`
        }
      })
    })
  })
}
```
